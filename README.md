The intended purpose of this project is to be a mobile app that can be used to log your workouts and then show analytics for various data.
Has been forgotten but will be recycled and reused to eventually be finished.

Specifics:
I'm not sure about how I'm to go about the accessibility of the app but I want the app to allow input of various workouts, with information such as sets and reps, and show analytics like weight progression, your activity with the app, bad or good days, accomplishments, etc.
